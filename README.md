# RateCity Developer Test

Your task is to build a ReactJS powered page to:
- request a list of items from a JSON REST api
- render the table of results to page
- add ability to paginate the collection

Our expectations:
- Redux for state management (where necessary)
- Good component structure
- ES6
- Surprise us

## Notes
Use a starter kit of your choice.
Feel free to use npm packages to help you achieve a result.

## Deliverable
Submit a pull request against this repository. Developers will review your code and ask you questions in the pull request.

We will pull your code and execute the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
These commands should start a Node.JS server and serve your app in development mode. We expect the terminal to display a URL to see your code in browser. Recommended url is `http://localhost:3000`

## API Detail

API Endpoint:<br />
`http://blaze.ratecity.com.au/api/search/home-loans`

Paginate by passing the page parameter:<br />
`http://blaze.ratecity.com.au/api/search/home-loans?page=2`

API will return you an object that looks something like this:
```json
{
  "filters": [],
  "hits": [
    {
      "advertised_rate":3.88,
      "comparison_rate":4.28,

        "name":"loans.com.au"
      }
    }

    "hit_count": 25,
    "page": 1,
